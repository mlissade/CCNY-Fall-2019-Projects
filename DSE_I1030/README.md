# DSE I1030 - Applied Statistics

## Course Description

This course will examine real data sets from a variety of domains, examine multiple models for these data sets, assess the validity of modeling assumptions, and determine the strength of conclusions that can be drawn. The course will include project-based learning. A strong emphasis will be placed on the critical analysis of modeling assumptions in real-world settings.

## Project

### [Error Analysis of in situ Sea Surface Temperature Data](/DSE_I1030/Project2.ipynb)

#### Project Description

This project takes a close look at the measurements made from an individual platform (a particular ship, DB, or MB), provided with the matched OSTIA SST values and their error estimates, students will compare the two, characterize the statistical distribution of their difference (the “error”), identify and discuss the outliers (some of which are due to clear cases of a recording error or typo) and look for a possible inﬂuence of various factors, like a season or a time of the day, or platform history and its metadata, on the bias and magnitude of the error, as well as on the temporal persistence of the error.
