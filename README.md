## DSE I1020 - Introduction to Data Science

### Course Description

This course presented a survey to Data Science and introduced some of the core data science tools. While some programming experience was required for the course, the course included a rapid introduction to Data Science programming and the stack of tools needed to process, visualize and analyze data stack with Python. As students, we were given a high-level survey of data engineering, visual analytics, applied statistics, machine learning, and big data. The course illustrated this bringing us through real data sets and case studies.

## DSE I1030 - Applied Statistics

### Course Description

This course will examine real data sets from a variety of domains, examine multiple models for these data sets, assess the validity of modeling assumptions, and determine the strength of conclusions that can be drawn. The course will include project-based learning. A strong emphasis will be placed on the critical analysis of modeling assumptions in real-world settings.
