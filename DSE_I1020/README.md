# DSE I1020 - Introduction to Data Science

## Course Description

This course presented a survey to Data Science and introduced some of the core data science tools. While some programming experience was required for the course, the course included a rapid introduction to Data Science programming and the stack of tools needed to process, visualize and analyze data stack with Python. As students, we were given a high-level survey of data engineering, visual analytics, applied statistics, machine learning, and big data. The course illustrated this bringing us through real data sets and case studies.
